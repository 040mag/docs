# Laravel Forge

So, you've built a sweet Laravel application on your local [Homestead](/docs/homestead) environment, but how do you launch it on the web?

One of Laravel's primary goals is to make PHP application development enjoyable from download to deploy. This goal is fulfilled by a variety of solutions. [Laravel Homestead](/docs/homestead) provides an amazing local development environment for all of your PHP and Laravel applications. The Laravel framework itself provides a robust framework and foundation for your applications, with powerful features and an expressive syntax. And, finally, [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.coM) provides a simple, convenient way to launch and deploy your applications.

Forge can quickly provision blazing fast servers on DigitalOcean, Linode, Rackspace, and Amazon EC2. And, like Homestead, Forge installs all of the latest goodies for you, including:

- Nginx
- PHP 5.5
- MySQL
- Postgres
- Redis
- Memcached
- Beanstalk

After deploying your application onto Forge, "Quick Deploy" can deploy fresh code each time you push to Github or Bitbucket! Even more, once your application is running, Forge can help you configure sub-domains, Cron jobs, SSL, queue workers, and more. And, since the servers stay on your personal account with the provider of your choice, you maintain full control of the server, including full shell access.
