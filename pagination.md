## Configuration

In other frameworks, pagination can be very painful. Laravel makes it a breeze. Laravel can generate an intelligent "range" of links based on the current page. The generated HTML is compatible with the [Bootstrap CSS framework](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## Paginating Database Records

There are several ways to paginate items. The simplest is by using the `paginate` method on the [query builder](/docs/{{version}}/queries) or an [Eloquent model](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent). The `paginate` method provided by Laravel automatically takes care of setting the proper limit and offset based on the current page being viewed by the user. By default, the current page is detected by the value of the `?page` query string argument. Of course, this value is automatically detected by Laravel, and is also automatically inserted into links generated by the paginator.

### Paginating Query Builder Results

First, let's take a look at calling the `paginate` method on a query generated by the query builder:

	<?php namespace App\Http\Controllers;

	use DB;
	use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;

	class UserController extends Controller
	{
		/**
		 * Show all of the users for the application.
		 *
		 * @return Response
		 */
		public function index()
		{
			$users = DB::table('users')->paginate(15);

			return view('user.index', ['users' => $users]);
		}
	}

In this example, the only argument passed to `paginate` is the number of items we would like displayed "per page". In this case, we specified that we would like to display `15` items per page.

> **Note:** Currently, pagination operations that use a `groupBy` statement cannot be executed efficiently by Laravel. If you need to use a `groupBy` with a paginated result set, it is recommended that you query the database and create a paginator manually.

### Paginating Eloquent Models

You may also paginate [Eloquent](/docs/{{version}}/eloquent) models. In this example, we will paginate the `User` model with `15` items per page. As you can see, the syntax is nearly identical to paginating query builder results:

	$allUsers = User::paginate(15);

Of course, you may call `paginate` after setting other constraints on the query:

	$someUsers = User::where('votes', '>', 100)->paginate(15);

#### "Simple Pagination"

If you are only showing "Next" and "Previous" links in your pagination view, you have the option of using the `simplePaginate` method to perform a more efficient query. This is useful for larger datasets when you do not require the display of exact page numbers on your view:

	$someUsers = User::where('votes', '>', 100)->simplePaginate(15);

### Creating A Paginator Manually

Sometimes you may wish to create a pagination instance manually, passing it an array of items. You may do so by creating either an `Illuminate\Pagination\Paginator` or `Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator` instance, depending on your needs.

The `Paginator` class does not need to know the total number of items in the result set; however, because of this, the class does not have methods for retrieve the index of the last page. The `LengthAwarePaginator` accepts almost the same arguments as the `Paginator`, except that it does require a count of the total number of items in the result set.

In other words, the `Paginator` corresponds to the `simplePaginate` method on the query builder and Eloquent, while the `LengthAwarePaginator` corresponds to the `pagiante` method.

## Displaying Results

When you call the `paginate` or `simplePaginate` methods on a query builder or Eloquent query, you will receive a paginator instance. When calling the `paginate` method, you will receive an instance of `Illuminate\Pagination\LengthAwarePaginator`.

When calling the `simplePaginate` method, you will receive an instance `Illuminate\Pagination\Paginator`. These objects provide several methods that describe the result set. In addition to these helpers methods, the paginator instances are iterators and may be looped as an array.

So, once you have retrieved the results, you may display the results and page links using [Blade](/docs/{{version}}/views):

	<div class="container">
		@foreach ($users as $user)
			{{ $user->name }}
		@endforeach
	</div>

	{!! $users->render() !!}

The `render` method will render the links to the rest of the pages in the result set. Each of these links will already contain the proper `?page` query string variable.

> **Note:** When calling the `render` method from a Blade template, be sure to use the `{!! !!}` echo syntax so the HTML links will not be escaped.

#### Customizing The Paginator URI

The `setPath` method allows you to customize the URI used by the paginator when generating links. For example, if you want the paginator to generate links like `http://example.com/custom/url?page=N`, you should pass `custom/url` to the `setPath` method:

	$results->setPath('custom/url');

#### Appending To Pagination Links

You may add to the query string of pagination links using the `appends` method. For example, to append `&sort=yes` to each pagination link, you should make the following call to `appends`:

	{!! $users->appends(['sort' => 'votes'])->render() !!}

If you wish to append a "hash fragment" to the paginator's URLs, you may use the `fragment` method. For example, to append `#foo` to the end of each pagination link, make the following call to the `fragment` method:

	{!! $users->fragment('foo')->render() !!}

#### Additional Helper Methods

You may also access additional pagination information via the following methods on paginator instances:

- `$results->count()`
- `$results->currentPage()`
- `$results->hasMorePages()`
- `$results->lastPage() (Not available when using simplePaginate)`
- `$results->nextPageUrl()`
- `$results->perPage()`
- `$results->total() (Not available when using simplePaginate)`
- `$results->url($page)`

## Converting To JSON

The `Paginator` class implements the `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\JsonableInterface` contract and exposes the `toJson` method. You may also convert a `Paginator` instance to JSON by returning it from a route. The JSON'd form of the instance will include some "meta" information such as `total`, `current_page`, and `last_page`. The instance's data will be available via the `data` key in the JSON array.
